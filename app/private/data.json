      "description": "The third floor provides a study space available to all students who know how to sneak into the POST building past 7pm. Other than the fact that they barricaded the doors with state of the art locks, using the trick that I like to call, going AROUND the building, seems to do the trick. IC Space comes with a snack bar and tables outside if they're having their annual anime yikes meetings.",
